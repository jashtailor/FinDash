## Common Issues

### "Failed to open spreadsheet"

- Did you add the Spreadsheet ID to `config.py`?
- Check that the ID is inside the quotes

### Can't see the app in browser

- Check the terminal for errors
- Make sure port 8501 isn't in use
- Try navigating manually to `http://localhost:8501`

### Import fails

- Make sure your CSV has columns: `date`, `payee`, `amount`
- Check that dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Ensure amounts are numbers (negative for expenses)

## Tips for Best Experience

### Mobile Use

- The app is mobile-friendly!
- Open `http://your-computer-ip:8501` on your phone (same network)

### CSV Format

Your bank's CSV export should work with minimal changes:
- Rename columns to: `date`, `payee`, `amount`
- Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD
- Make expenses negative (e.g., -50.00)

### Performance

- The app caches data for 5 minutes
- Default view shows last 60 days of transactions
- Use date filters to narrow down large datasets

## What's Next?

Now that you're set up, you can:

1. **Import your real bank data** - Export CSV from your bank and import
2. **Set monthly budgets** - Track spending against budgets
3. **Create rules** - Automate categorization for recurring merchants
4. **Explore analytics** - View spending trends and patterns
